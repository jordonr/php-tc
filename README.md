PHP Task Command

Basic layout or framework to make php tasks that are to be run from the command-line.

I have included a few packages that were used for my needs so make sure to edit the composer.json as needed and run composer.

Wrote this out of a random need to check and update a SOAP API every 5 minutes.  I tried Mono, Ruby, Perl and Python but only PHP generated the correct SOAP calls for this specific API.
